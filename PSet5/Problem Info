Completed problems 1-11. Did not complete problem 12 since I could not find a workaround for the parser.
The provided parser does not work due to some changes in the Python module 'collections'

## RSS Feed Filter

Code is provided to parse news for an RSS feed. Goal is to create a class of objects that contain news and related info,
and classes to filter news stories

Problem 1:

Create the class *NewsStory* with the attributes below and related getter methods.

-- story id
-- title
-- description
-- web link
-- publication date
-- category


## Triggers

Code is provided for a *Trigger* class. The class has no functionality-- various subclasses were written that filter
news objects in problems 2-10.

Problem 2:

Create the *Trigger* subclass *PhaseTrigger* which checks whether a phrase exists in a string


Problem 3:

Create the *PhaseTrigger* subclass *TitleTrigger* which filters titles for a given phrase


Problem 4:

Create the *PhaseTrigger* subclass *DescriptionTrigger* which filters descriptions for a given phrase


## Time Triggers

Create time based filters

Problem 5:

Create the *Trigger* subclass *TimeTrigger*


Problem 6:

Create the *TimeTrigger* subclasses *BeforeTrigger* and *AfterTrigger*. These subclasses filters news stories
that occur before or after a certain time.


## Composite Triggers

Allow for more complex triggers based on whether filters are not present or occur simultaneously

Problem 7:

Create the *Trigger* subclass *NotTrigger*  which filters news stories based on whether another trigger does not appear.


Problem 8:

Create the *Trigger* subclass *And Trigger*  which filters news stories based on whether two triggers occur together.


Problem 9:

Create the *Trigger* subclass *OrTrigger*  which filters news stories based on whether at least one of two triggers
appears.


## Filters

Helper code is provided that reads and parses a file containing trigger definitions. Code is also provided to display
the RSS feed however the feed does not populate to changes in Python that affected the helper code for news parsing

Problem 10

Write a function, filter_stories(stories, triggerlist) that takes in a list of news
stories and a list of triggers, and returns a list of only the stories for which a trigger fires.
