Completed all problems (Parts A, B, and C)

Part A: Permutations of a string

-- Write a *recursive* procedure that generates all possible permutations of a string

Part B: Cipher like Caesar

-- Uses Caesar Cipher (shifting all alphabet characters) to encrypt messages
-- Completed skeleton of code for a class and two subclasses for encryption and decryption

Part C: Substitution Cipher

-- Substitute vowels for other vowels to encrypt messages. Permutation map has considerably more possible
maps, so we only substitute vowels in the problem.
-- Completed skeleton of code for a class and two subclasses for encryption and decryption. Slightly different
classes than in part B
