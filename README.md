## Overview

This repo includes all problem sets from the open MIT Course Introduction to Computer Science and Progamming in Python. The repo includes
python code for problem sets 0 through 5 a file unrelated to the course.

## Files

A basic description of the problem sets is below. Each directory also contains a file labeled **Problem Info** containing more detailed
information about the project/assignment.

- Problem set 0 was an introductory assignment working with basic python operations, syntax, and functions
- Problem sets 1 involved working with user inputs and performing arithmetic operations related to finance/saving
- Problem set 2 created an interactive Hangman game and worked with user inputs, data structures, and writing functions
- Problem set 3 created another interactive word game and worked with worked with user inputs, data structures, and writing functions
- Problem set 4 involved recursion and used classes and inheritance to encrypt and decode test
- Problem set 5 further explored classes and inheritance to create RSS feed filters
- The file Recursion.py is not part of the course but includes some functions I wrote while practicing recursive programming.

### Notes: 

1. Psets 1 and 2 are partially completed. The baseline features run, but more advanced features were skipped due to time constraints
2. For pset 3 all problems were completed. However the console output for the game is not fully optimized 
3. For pset 5 all problems were completed. However the helper code for parsing is no longer functional so the RSS feed does not populate

Thanks to MIT and the Comp Sci department for making these lectures and assignments available and to the instructors for excellent lectures.
