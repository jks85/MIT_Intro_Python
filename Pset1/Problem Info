## Cube Root
The file Cube_Root.py is not from the problem set. It includes a few procedures for finding cube roots
using the following methods:

- Guess and check
- Approximation method
- Bisect method


The bisection method was also written to allow cube roots of any real number. The guess and check method
works only for integers.
